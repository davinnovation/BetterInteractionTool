Dragablz Meetz MahApps
=

Demo applications to show [Dragablz](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz) and [MahApps](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) being used together.

There are three runnable projects in the solution so try them all:

	* DragablzWindowApp - } show same code running { - DragablzWindow
	* MahAppsWindowApp  - }                        { - MetroWindow
	* StylezApp          - showcases custom styles in Dragablz, specific designed for MahApps


The code also illustrates a potential way you can use MVVM to populate your tabs.
